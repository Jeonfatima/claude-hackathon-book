# Generate tasks for frontend-backend integration

## Prompt Text

```
/sp.tasks
```

## Response Text

Generated tasks.md file for the frontend-backend integration feature based on the spec, plan, data model, contracts, and research documents. The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing, following the required checklist format with Task IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome

Successfully created tasks.md file in C:\Users\LAPTOP WORLD\Documents\code\hackathon-qwen\specs\003-frontend-backend-integration\tasks.md with 32 tasks organized across 6 phases including setup, foundational, and user stories prioritized as P1 and P2.

## Evaluation

The tasks.md file follows the required format with proper Task IDs, story labels, and file paths. Each task is specific enough for an LLM to complete without additional context. The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing as required.
