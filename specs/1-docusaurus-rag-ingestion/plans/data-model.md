# Data Model: Docusaurus URL Ingestion System

**Feature**: Docusaurus URL ingestion, embedding generation, and vector storage
**Date**: 2025-12-14

## Entity: DocusaurusContent

Represents the text extracted from a Docusaurus website, including page hierarchy, metadata, and original URL.

**Attributes**:
- `url`: String - The source URL of the content (required)
- `title`: String - The title of the page (required)
- `content`: String - The extracted text content (required)
- `metadata`: Dict - Additional metadata (headers, hierarchy, etc.) with default empty dict
- `created_at`: DateTime - When the content was extracted (auto-generated)

**Validation Rules**:
- URL must be a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL
- Content must not be empty
- Title must not be empty

## Entity: EmbeddingVector

The semantic representation of content generated by Cohere's embedding model, linked to the source content.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: String - Unique identifier for the vector (auto-generated)
- `content_id`: String - Reference to source content (required)
- `vector`: List[float] - The embedding vector values (required)
- `payload`: Dict - Metadata associated with the vector (required)
- `created_at`: DateTime - When the embedding was generated (auto-generated)

**Validation Rules**:
- Vector must have exactly 1024 dimensions (for Cohere embeddings)
- Content_id must reference an existing DocusaurusContent
- Payload must include at least URL and content snippet

## Entity: QdrantCollection

A container in the Qdrant vector database that holds embeddings for a specific documentation set.

**Attributes**:
- `name`: String - Name of the collection (default: "rag_embeddings")
- `vector_size`: Integer - Dimension of vectors in collection (default: 1024)
- `distance`: String - Distance metric (default: "Cosine")
- `created_at`: DateTime - When the collection was created (auto-generated)

**Validation Rules**:
- Collection name must follow Qdrant naming conventions
- Vector size must match embedding dimensions (1024 for Cohere)
- Distance metric must be one of: Cosine, Euclidean, Dot
