# Quickstart Guide: Docusaurus URL Ingestion System

**Feature**: Docusaurus URL ingestion, embedding generation, and vector storage
**Date**: 2025-12-14

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Cohere API key
- Qdrant instance (local or cloud)

## Setup

### 1. Clone and Navigate to Backend Directory

```bash
# Create backend directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p backend
cd backend
```

### 2. Initialize Python Package

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Initialize package
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install cohere qdrant-client beautifulsoup4 requests python-dotenv
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
QDRANT_HOST=your_qdrant_host_here  # e.g., "localhost" or "https://your-cluster.qdrant.tech"
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key_here  # if using cloud
QDRANT_PORT=6333  # default port
```

## Running the Ingestion Pipeline

### 1. Prepare the main.py File

Create `main.py` with the complete implementation containing all required functions.

### 2. Execute the Pipeline

```bash
cd backend
python main.py --url "https://hackathon-claude-textbook.vercel.app/"
```

## Expected Output

When the pipeline runs successfully, you should see:

1. Discovery of all URLs from the target site
2. Content extraction from each page
3. Text chunking process
4. Embedding generation
5. Storage in Qdrant collection named "rag_embeddings"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Rate Limits**: If you encounter rate limit errors, implement longer delays between API calls.

**URL Discovery**: If not all pages are discovered, verify that the base URL is correct and that the site doesn't require authentication.

**Qdrant Connection**: Ensure your Qdrant instance is running and accessible with the provided credentials.

### Verification Steps

1. Check that all URLs were discovered by reviewing the logs
2. Verify embeddings were generated by confirming Cohere API usage
3. Confirm vectors are stored in Qdrant by checking the collection size

## Next Steps

After successful execution:
1. The Qdrant collection "rag_embeddings" will contain the processed content
2. You can query these embeddings for RAG applications
3. Monitor the collection size and performance for optimization
