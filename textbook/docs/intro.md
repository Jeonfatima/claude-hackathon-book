# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This textbook is designed to provide a thorough understanding of the fundamental concepts, technologies, and practical implementations in the field of humanoid robotics and physical artificial intelligence.

## Overview

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Explore the Robot Operating System and its role in coordinating robotic functions
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Learn about simulation environments for robot development and testing
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Understand AI frameworks for robot perception and decision-making
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Discover how robots integrate vision, language, and action capabilities

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this textbook, you will be able to:
- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create and test robots in simulation environments
- Integrate AI capabilities into robotic systems
- Develop vision-language-action systems for autonomous robots

## Prerequisites

This textbook assumes familiarity with:
- Basic programming concepts (preferably Python)
- Fundamentals of robotics
- Linear algebra and calculus basics

## How to Use This Textbook

Each module contains multiple chapters with theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. We recommend progressing through the modules sequentially to build a solid foundation, though advanced users may navigate to specific topics as needed.
