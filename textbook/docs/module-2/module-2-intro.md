# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module focuses on digital twin technology, which creates virtual replicas of physical robotic systems. We'll explore simulation environments that allow for safe and efficient testing of robotic algorithms before deployment on real hardware.

## Overview

In this module, we'll cover:
- Gazebo physics simulation for realistic robot testing
- Unity for visualization and human-robot interaction
- Sensor simulation including LiDAR, cameras, and IMU
- Integration between simulation and real-world robotics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo physics simulations
- Create Unity scenes for robot visualization
- Simulate various sensors and interpret their data
- Validate robotic algorithms in simulated environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D environments
- Understanding of sensor technologies
