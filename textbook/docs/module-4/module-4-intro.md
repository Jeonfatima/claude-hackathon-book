# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module explores Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, which enable robots to perceive visual information, understand natural language commands, and execute appropriate actions. This integration is crucial for human-robot interaction and autonomous decision-making.

## Overview

In this module, we'll investigate:
- Voice-to-action systems using technologies like Whisper
- Cognitive planning with Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Integration of vision, language, and action capabilities
- A comprehensive capstone project: an autonomous humanoid robot

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement voice recognition and action mapping systems
- Integrate LLMs for cognitive planning in robotics
- Create multimodal systems that combine vision, language, and action
- Design an autonomous humanoid robot system

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Understanding of natural language processing
- Basic knowledge of computer vision
- Familiarity with planning algorithms
