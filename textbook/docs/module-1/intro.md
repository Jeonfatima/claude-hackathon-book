# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure, tools, and libraries necessary to build complex robotic systems.

## Overview

In this module, we'll explore:
- The architecture of ROS 2 and its improvements over ROS 1
- Core concepts like nodes, topics, services, and actions
- How to create Python agents that control robotic systems
- Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) for humanoid robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the ROS 2 architecture and its key components
- Create and connect nodes that communicate via topics and services
- Develop Python agents that interact with ROS controllers
- Define humanoid robot models using URDF

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts
