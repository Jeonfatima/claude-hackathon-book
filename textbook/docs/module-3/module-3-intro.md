# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This module explores NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive platform for developing AI-powered robotic applications. Isaac provides tools for perception, navigation, manipulation, and simulation that enable robots to understand and interact with the world.

## Overview

In this module, we'll examine:
- Isaac Sim for creating synthetic data and training environments
- Isaac ROS for perception and navigation capabilities
- Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
- Path planning and bipedal movement algorithms

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and use Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation
- Implement VSLAM algorithms using Isaac ROS
- Design path planning systems for navigation
- Develop bipedal movement controllers for humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Understanding of machine learning concepts
- Basic knowledge of computer vision
- Familiarity with robotics kinematics
